# 4-Bit-ALU
Created a 4-bit arithmetic-logic unit using various digital design techniques and hierarchical modeling in VHDL.

Consists of an arithmetic unit and a logical unit to handle both functions based on the user-input select lines. The functionality was demonstrated on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA and the output was displayed on a seven-segment display with an LED to indicate overflow.
